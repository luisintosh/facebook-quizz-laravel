## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DummyDataSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DummyDataSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command
